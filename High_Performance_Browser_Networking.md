## Primer on Latency and Bandwidth
* `Latency`
* `Bandwidth`
* Components of latency
  * Propogation delay
  * Transmission delay
  * Processing delay
  * Queuing delay
* `Bufferbloat`
  * Coined by Jim Gettys in 2010.

## Buidling Blocks of TCP
* `IP`
  * Routing
  * Addressing
* `TCP`
  * Provides abstraction of a reliable network over an unreliable channel.
  * Retransmission
  * In-order delivery
  * Congestion control
  * Congestion avoidance
  * Data integrity
* `TCP/IP`
  * Referred as Internet Protocol Suite.
  * Proposed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn in 1974 paper titled "A Protocol For Packet Network Intercommunication".
  * The original proposal (RFC 675) was revised several times, and in 1981 the v4 specification of TCP/IP was published not as one, but as two separate RFCs:
    * RFC 791 — Internet Protocol
    * RFC 793 — Transmission Control Protocol
